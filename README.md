# Implementation of a Simple Neural Network
The goal of this excercise is to explore the application of a simple neural network to a small data set to understand how different parameters of the neural network affect the output. The parameters that are adjusted include different types of activation functions, different combinations of neurons and layers, and feature engineering.
